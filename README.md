[![Monthly Data Update](https://github.com/ChefAharoni/HaaretzMusafim/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ChefAharoni/HaaretzMusafim/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Since Haaretz doesn't provide a an organized archive for their Musafim (weekend magazines), this repo takes each week's url of the magazine, and displays it as a list.

Currently working on a search bar function from Algolia on a different branch - no success so far. If anyone is farmiliar with it and would like to work on it - feel free.

**FrontEnd needed!**

Disclaimer:
This repo is not associated in any way with Haaretz, and does not provide illegaly its content. Its sole purpose is to organize the web pages in an archive, in a way it'll be easier to access them. 
A paid membership to Haaretz is still needed to view these magazines.
