# Musafei Haaretz

Since Haaretz doesn't provide a an organized archive for their Musafim (weekend magazines), this repo takes each week's url of the magazine, and displays it as a list.

**FrontEnd needed!**

Currently hosted for free here - http://chefaharonibmcc.pythonanywhere.com
Can't host on GitHub Pages since the site is not static (and we don't want to use JS :))

Disclaimer:
This repo is not associated in any way with Haaretz, and does not provide illegaly its content. Its sole purpose is to organize the web pages in an archive, in a way it'll be easier to access them. 
A paid membership to Haaretz is still needed to view these magazines.
